Overview
========

Rubolt is designed for developers who want:

* **Modern language features**: Pattern matching, generics, comprehensive error handling
* **High performance**: JIT compilation, optimized runtime, native code generation
* **Rich ecosystem**: Comprehensive standard library, development tools, package management
* **Seamless interoperability**: Python integration, C extensions, DLL support
* **Developer experience**: VS Code integration, debugger, profiler, formatter, linter

Key Features
============

Core Language
-------------

* **Advanced Type System**: Static typing with inference, generics with constraints, union types
* **Pattern Matching**: Guards, destructuring, type patterns with comprehensive matching
* **Error Handling**: Result types, try/catch blocks, comprehensive error propagation
* **JIT Compilation**: Hot path detection, native code generation, optimization passes

Performance & Runtime
---------------------

* **Fast C Runtime**: Optimized interpreter with type-aware execution
* **Memory Management**: Both garbage collection and reference counting
* **Concurrency**: Async/await, threading, atomic operations
* **Inline Caching**: Optimized method/property access with performance statistics

Development Tools
-----------------

* **REPL**: Interactive shell with history, completion, and debugging
* **Debugger**: Breakpoints, step debugging, variable inspection
* **Profiler**: Performance analysis, hot path identification, flame graphs
* **Language Server**: Full LSP support for VS Code and other editors
* **Testing Framework**: Unit tests, property-based testing, benchmarks

Interoperability
----------------

* **Python Integration**: GCC-to-Python compiler, C bridge, FFI helpers
* **C Extensions**: Native module API, SDK for extension development
* **DLL Support**: Automatic loading and compilation of native libraries
* **Package Management**: Dependency resolution, semantic versioning
